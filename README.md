This is an Emacs guide written for JavaScript coders. It'll cover installation, basic text editing to taking advantage 
of powerful extensions made for NodeJS and JavaScript.

### Setup

This guide will be based on `emacs.js`, a ready-to-use setup for JavaScript coders. Go to your home directory and follow these commands;

```
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/azer/emacs.js
$ cd emacs.js
$ make
```

Once you're done, you can start emacs by running:

```bash
$ emacs
```

### Editing

Once you have Emacs open, press `C-x C-f` (Control-x Control-f) buttons to find a file to find a file to open. To create a new file, press `C-x C-f` again, type a filename and `enter`.
